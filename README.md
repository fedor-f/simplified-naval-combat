# simplified-naval-combat
This console app is a simplified naval combat game where you can only attack ships of your enemy.<br/>
These are conventions:
  1. '.' - the cell was not shot;
  2. '*' - the cell was hit but a player did not hit a ship;
  3. 'X' - the cell was hit and a player hit a ship;
  4. '^' - sunken ship.
